Hi, my name is Yuanmin Tang (Chinese: 唐源民), a Ph.D. Candidate (4<sup>th</sup> year student, 2021.09–2026.06) at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Dr. Jing Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F7YBgScAAAAJ). I am currently a research intern in the **Data, Knowledge, and Intelligence (DKI)** team at **Microsoft**, originally part of Microsoft Research Asia, supervised by [Dr. Jue Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/juezhang/). 

Previously, I have authored six research papers, including highlights at CVPR and oral presentations at AAAI. I actively serve as a reviewer for CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and ICME, and was honored with the **Top Reviewer Award at NeurIPS**.

**<ins>🚀🔍: <font color=Blue>I am open to research collaborations and looking forward to Postdoctoral opportunities in 2026!</font></ins>**

## 📖 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **vision, language, and explainable learning**, with a particular focus on:

- **🧠 Reflective Chain-of-Thought for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval**
- **🎯 Multimodal & Vision-Language Models** (e.g., CLIP, BLIP)
- **💬 Cross-modal Sponsored Search**
- **🔐 Vision-Language Model Watermarking**
- **🧾 Explainable and Transparent Machine Learning**
