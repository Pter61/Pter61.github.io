Hi, my name is Yuanmin Tang (Chinese: 唐源民), a Ph.D. Candidate (4<sup>th</sup> year student, 2021-2026) at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Beijing, China, advised by [Dr. Jing Yu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=P75F9-QAAAAJ). Currently, I am also an intern in the Data, Knowledge, Intelligence (DKI) team at Microsoft, previously part of Microsoft Research Asia, supervised by [Dr. Jue Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/juezhang/). I also closely collaborate with [Prof. Qi Wu](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/qi.wu) from the University of Adelaide.

**<ins>🔥🔜: <font color=Blue>I am actively seeking opportunities as a Research Intern or Research Assistant, aiming toward future roles such as Postdoctoral Researcher upon graduation!</font></ins>**

## 📖 Research

My primary research interests are centered around advanced multimodal learning and explainable artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on:

* **<ins>⭐ Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval</ins>**
* Multimodal Large Language Models
* Cross-modal Sponsored Search
* Explainable Machine Learning
* Watermarking Techniques in Vision-Language Models

**PS: If you're interested in collaboration or just want to chat, feel free to reach out via e-mail at [tangyuanmin@iie.ac.cn](mailto:tangyuanmin@iie.ac.cn), or via wechat at Peter20200618.**
